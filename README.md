Cydekick is a Cypress test code generator designed for React applications. It enables you to visualize the component hierarchy of your React application, interact with your application in real-time, and seamlessly generate test code.

## Prerequisites

To use Cydekick, you will need to:

- Install Cypress in your application.
- Add your own "data-cy" IDs to elements you wish to test on your app.
- Run your application concurrently.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install Cydekick:

1. Download the latest version of Cydekick
2. Choose the version that matches your operating system: Mac, Windows, or Linux.


## Usage

To use Cydekick effectively, follow these steps:

1. Launch Cydekick.

2. Input the files of your React application and the URL where it's hosted.

3. Explore the component hierarchy using React Flow and select the component of your application that you want to test.

4. Generate test code by providing text for "describe" and "it" blocks, and selecting Cypress commands.

5. Ensure you add the statement to the editor by clicking the "end statement" button.

6. Complete the "describe" block and click "preview" at the top right to view your test file.

7. Congratulations on your first test code; You're free to edit, preview, or save the generated code.
